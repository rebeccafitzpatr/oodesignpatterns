This program will be another application of the strategy design pattern

ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

human vs computer

We will use three stategies for the game play:
the CPU can either play random actions,
OR
cycle through the order of ROCK, then PAPER, then SCISSORS

OR 
copy the humans previous action

but to make it more unpredictable for the human, we will add logic to change between these strategies during the run time.
